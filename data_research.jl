So apply, but don't get your hopes up.", "While I can't speak on your admissions chances to any of these schools, I'm about to be in a similar boat as you but for grad school, and in a similar field. Currently an undergrad Astronomy student at UT Austin, and while you don't have to have it figured out you might want to consider whether you want a pure Physics or Astronomy degree. Some schools allow a double major and with your AP credit you should easily be able to acquire a double major in Astronomy and Physics so long as your University allows both. If you're planning on going to grad school (which is almost required to do meaningful research in these fields) then doing research in undergrad is becoming more and more important (some would argue more important than undergrad GPA). This is something to consider in terms of applying to a T20 research University. How early can you start research at these universities. Rice I know for a fact has a very small astronomy program. MIT has a strong bias towards physics, but if you favor physics over Astronomy then that's nothing to worry about. This is me purely theorizing from my undergrad experience, but you can have just as meaningful an undergrad experience at any T20 research school in the US. You already have some of the calculus and physics done, so your first year is likely going to include stat mech, vector calc and/or linear algebra, thermo, and hopefully some research opportunities and intro Astro courses because it is very easy to burn out on just physics. Some of the best undergrad Astronomy programs for research that I know of are UT, Baylor, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Berkeley, and U Hawaii. Now I imagine all of these except Baylor will absolutely jump at your application not to mention they will most likely be much more affordable. UT and UC Berkeley probably have the largest Hispanic populations of the ones mentioned, but UC Santa Cruz wouldn't be unaccepting. Baylor is a private technically Baptist college, even if they let u in (your more than quallified, but idk how they view nonbinary cantidates they are kinda wack) Waco is not a terribly accepting area so u may not enjoy your time there. I know I don't have anything useful in terms of the schools you mentioned, but I want to reassure you that in the astronomy field, the name of the school you go to for undergrad isn't as important as relevant research in the field you plan on going into for grad school. An undergrad with a 4.0 from MIT who never did any research vs an undergrad from UC Santa Cruz with a 3.2 GPA and a conference paper or even just a few years research and nothing published  will have vastly different chances of getting into grad school. I'd venture to say, most T20 schools for astronomy would prefer the UC Santa Cruz student. Of course this is a simplification and depends of the grad programs funding, current research, professors, and letters of rec. Just trying to provide Info. Hope this helps, and don't feel bad if u do get into a less prestigious school.
